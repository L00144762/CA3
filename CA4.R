# Conclusion
#low p value in the lineare models show there is enough evidence to reject H0 and that
# there is a statistical significant relationship between rainfall and temperature.
# However, the low correlation and lack of explanation for the variance in the data given by the model
# tell us the relationship is  not practically significant 
# the predictive models were 20% accurate which is low. Given that the model diagnostics were indicitive
# of a poor fit, this comes as no surprise.There are most definitely other variables unaccounted for that would
# have affected both the rain and temp data. The fact that the values in eachset were average values means
# the granularity was already effected but these were the only relevant datasets found in relation to this topic.
# A lot of data had to be removed from the dataset as result of missing values, had these values been usable then
# the models would have been more robust in their prediction. The missing values accounted for almost half the weather
# station data in Ireland, this was frustrating as it hindered the initial analysis and the subsequent predictive analysis.
# Heatwaves, unusually heavy downpours or storms would have effected the data and were not taken into account when
# carrying out analysis. These extra variables should be included along with any others that might directly effect rainfall and 
# temperature data if the study was to be carried out again. The missing data might have included information that could have accounted
# for the presence of an unseen variable but unfortunately this is just an assumption. 
# alter research questiona and carry out time series analysis.
